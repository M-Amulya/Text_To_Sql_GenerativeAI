# Text_To_Sql_GenerativeAI_LLM_Application
I have created a Genarative AI Application using Google Gemini Pro.It's a Text to SQL LLM Application.

This App takes whatever text of prompt we give and it sends to LLM model (Gemini pro). The LLM model generates a query, this query executes and reads from SQL database and gives response.

Deployed the model in Hugging face
